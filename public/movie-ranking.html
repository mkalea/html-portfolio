<h1>The Best Movies According to Mika</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>I love this movie. is beautiful because it delicately 
   captures the bittersweet nature of love and memory, 
   illustrating how both the joyful and painful moments 
   shape our identities. Its imaginative storytelling and
    emotional depth invite us to reflect on the impermanence
     of relationships and the significance of cherishing even
      the imperfect parts of life.</p>

<h3>2. Wild Robot</h3>
<p>The movie is beautiful because it showcases the delicate 
   relationship between a robot and the animals of the wilderness,
    highlighting themes of empathy and survival. The story is
     heartwarming especially for someone like me who appreciates
      the beauty of animals and the natural world.</p>

<h3>3. Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar is impressive because it shows how time moves
    slower near a black hole, which is based on real science,
     a concept rooted in Einstein's theory of relativity.
      The movie makes this idea easy to understand while also
       delivering a powerful emotional story.</p>
