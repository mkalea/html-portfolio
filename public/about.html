<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hiya! My name is Michaela but you can call me Mika for short. I'm 26, born and raised in the Philippines. I am a licensed Electronics Engineer. I took up this course because I wanted to be an astronaut. I also enjoy solving math problems. I am a very curious person and want to know and learn everything - about our world! </p>

<p>I am a dedicated and responsible person. These traits I've learned ever since I started to have dogs, they taught me to become responsible, work hard, and above all be kind to all beings. During my leisure, I enjoy playing computer games, learning music - I play bass guitar, and watch educational videos on Youtube. My favourite places are the park - where I feed the birds, and the beach where I can dive and swim into the waves! </p>

<p>I was a sales agent in my previous job. I handled customers enquiring for products, guiding them throughout the purchase, troubleshooting when there is an issue, up to the post-sale concerns. I encounter different people everyday, so it really improved my communication skills a lot and also how to effectively handle the problems and provide satisfactory solutions. Now, I want to pursue my line of career and want to add IT skills as this would be very helpful in dealing with software systems.</p>
